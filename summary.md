### 4.4 Correctness

**Proof Method:** {{Choose an appropriate proof method}}

#### I. Key Properties Required for Correctness

The correctness of the algorithm depends on the following properties:

1. **{{Property 1}}**: {{Explanation}}
2. **{{Property 2}}**: {{Explanation}}
3. **{{Property 3}}**: {{Explanation}}

{{Explain how these properties support the correctness of the algorithm.}}

#### II. Correctness Proof

> Choose a proof method appropriate for the algorithm. The following structure is intended for algorithms proved using loop invariants. Replace it when another method is more suitable.

**Loop Invariant**

At the {{beginning / end}} of each iteration, the following properties hold:

**Invariant I: {{Name}}**

{{Precisely describe the property that remains unchanged throughout the iterations.}}

**Invariant II: {{Name, optional}}**

{{Describe the correctness property of the partial result or an additional state.}}

**Initialization**

{{Prove that the invariant holds before the first iteration.}}

**Maintenance**

Assume the invariant holds before the current iteration.

Consider the possible cases:

- **Case 1:** {{Explain why the invariant is preserved.}}
- **Case 2:** {{Explain why the invariant is preserved.}}

Therefore, the invariant continues to hold after the iteration.

**Termination**

{{Explain why the algorithm terminates.}}

{{Use the invariant and termination condition to prove that the final output satisfies the required postconditions.}}

#### III. Conclusion

{{Summarize why the algorithm produces the correct result for every valid input.}}

### 4.5 Complexity Analysis

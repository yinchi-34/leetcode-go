Go solutions and learning notes for LeetCode, organized by algorithm and data structure. The problem notes record:

- **How the approach emerged**: the first idea, where it fell short, and the key change in thinking.
- **Why the solution works**: correctness proofs using loop invariants, induction, exchange arguments, or other suitable methods.
- **Where the difficulty lies**: separate ratings for modeling, knowledge prerequisites, correctness reasoning, and implementation, with reasons for each score.
- **What transfers to other problems**: reusable methods and the conditions under which they apply.

Notes are added gradually. Some problems currently have only code and tests, or notes in one language.

## Reading a Problem

The [problem-note templates](templates/) use the following structure. Read the sections that match your current needs:

| Section | When to read it |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Problem information and difficulty ratings | To understand the problem and the requirements of the solution |
| 2. Problem understanding | When the goal or constraints are still unclear |
| 3. Initial approach | To compare your reasoning with the recorded thought process |
| 4. Algorithm specification: pseudocode, correctness, and complexity | To check the steps, proof, and computational cost |
| 5. Learning notes | When you get stuck or want to understand a mistake |
| 6. Key takeaways | To identify methods you can reuse |
| 7. Review log | To test your understanding after some time |
| 8. Related problems | To find further practice |

The four-dimensional rating evaluates **a specific solution under stated constraints**. Each dimension receives an independent score from 1 to 5; the scores are not summed. LeetCode official difficulty and the zerotrac rating are recorded separately. See the [rating criteria](docs/RATING.md).

## Running Tests

Requires Go 1.22 or later, as declared in [go.mod](go.mod). Run the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
go test ./Algorithms/greedy-algorithms/...
```

The first command tests all packages; the second tests one category.

## Adding a Problem

1. Create a directory under `Algorithms/<category>/` or `data-structures/<category>/`, named `<number>-<english-title>` in lowercase with hyphens. Introductory exercises go under `primers/`.
2. Add `solution.go` and `solution_test.go`, both using `package solution`. Test the examples, boundary cases, and cases that exercise the key branches of the algorithm.
3. When writing notes, copy the [English template](templates/summary.md) and [Chinese template](templates/summary.zh-CN.md) into the problem directory. Change `../docs/` to `../../../docs/` in the copied files, then replace the placeholders and remove the copying instructions in the opening comment.
4. Rate the solution using the [rating criteria](docs/RATING.md), stating its constraints and target complexity. Keep the facts, scores, and mathematical meaning consistent between the two languages.
5. Check terminology against the [shared glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md) and mathematical notation against the [GitHub math conventions](docs/GITHUB_MATH.md). Update the [CLRS index](docs/CLRS_INDEX.md), verify the relative links, and run `go test ./...`.
